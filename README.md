# sprouts-optimization
Optional Academic Project: Used the Python (NumPy) in Jupyter Notebook to successfully optimize the cost of stew per person for the free meal program. (Written paper attached as well)

Sprouts is a non-profit community-based organization at the University Of British Columbia. Their goal as an organization is to make healthy, affordable and sustainable foods accessible to everyone on campus. The food security initiatives aim to achieve this goal, one of these initiatives being the free meal cards providing 30 free meals a day. 
I believe that what Sprouts achieves is truly amazing and using the knowledge that I developed in my linear optimization class, I found that I could help gain some insight on keeping the cost of the stew (everyday cafe meal item) to a minimized cost s.t. the organization can afford to provide more free meals per day.

In this linear optimization class, the project section was optional, meaning that I was able to take initiative and personalize this project to have my own goals. I really enjoyed communicating with the Sprouts team and helping to improve their amazing initiative.

I have attached the pdf of my academic project paper if that interests you!
